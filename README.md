## üöÄ Key Features

- **Multi-Document Upload & Support**: Effortlessly upload and process a wide range of document types, including government-issued IDs (e.g., passports, driver's licenses), educational certificates, employment proofs, and more. Built-in file validation ensures only supported formats (PDF, JPG, PNG) are accepted, with drag-and-drop functionality for a smooth user experience.

- **Real-Time Status Tracking**: Gain instant visibility into verification progress with a dynamic dashboard. Users can monitor upload status, OCR processing, AI validation, and final approval/rejection in real-time, complete with progress bars, notifications, and detailed logs for auditing.

- **Secure OTP Verification Flow**: Enhance identity confirmation with one-time password (OTP) delivery via SMS or email. Integrated with services like Twilio, this feature adds a robust layer of two-factor authentication, ensuring only verified users can complete document submissions.

- **AI/ML Integration Ready**: Pre-configured hooks for popular OCR and AI verification APIs, allowing plug-and-play connectivity to tools like Google Cloud Vision, AWS Textract, or open-source Tesseract. Automate extraction of key fields (e.g., name, DOB, expiry date) and run ML-based checks for authenticity, with extensible modules for custom models.

- **Responsive & Accessible UI**: A clean, modern interface powered by Tailwind CSS, fully responsive across devices‚Äîfrom desktops to mobiles. Includes dark mode support, accessibility features (WCAG compliant), and customizable themes to match your brand.

- **Vercel-Optimized Deployment**: One-click deployment to Vercel for serverless scalability, automatic HTTPS, global CDN distribution, and zero-downtime updates. Environment variables make it easy to configure API keys and database connections.
